**Game Information**  
HoleyMoley is a multiplayer, 2D side-scrolling platformer inspired by Terraria, Worms, and Fortnite. As a very territorial mole, you fight against other moles to claim the ownership of the land. To be the one victorious mole, you need to first mine resources, and then craft tools & weaponry, and finally destroy your opponents' respawn totems. If you are the last mole standing amidst the rising lava, you win!  

The game was designed by a team of 4 seniors at Rice University in Spring 2022 as a part of senior design capstone project for educational purposes only.
