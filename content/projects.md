September - December 2021 [<a href="https://github.com/berkalpyakici/mscrm" class="uk-link-muted" target="_blank">Source</a>]

* A reference-based read-mapper which performs ungapped alignment of paired sample reads with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and spike-in contaminants on reference sequence.
* Results of mapping reads from SARS-COV-2 sequence:
  * Mapped 6,657,204 reads in 20.52 seconds, and thus, achieved 19,465,509 reads/min throughput on a 12-core/24-thread Ryzen 9 5900X CPU machine.
* Achieved recall of 0.999 and precision of 1.000.
