I am a senior majoring in computer science with a minor in data science at Rice University in Houston, TX. I am also pursing a master of science degree in the field of computer science as an upcoming fifth year student, advised by [Luay Nakhleh](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/). My research interests are the applications of machine learning methods in bioinformatics and natural language processing. I am currently working distance measures on phylogenetic networks to better quantify how dissimilar two pairs of networks are.

I have industry experience in Python, Java, and C for building distributed and scalable applications. Additionally, I used R, NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch in numerous data science projects that involve data visualization, analysis, machine learning, and more. Last but not the least, I used SQL for databases, as well as various NoSQL solutions (i.e. MongoDB).

Extracurricularly, I currently serve as the Co-President of [Rice Computer Science Club](https://csclub.rice.edu/). Additionally, I am the Public Affairs Officer at [Rice Eclipse](http://eclipse.rice.edu/) (:rocket: club), previously serving as the Avionics Team Manager. Here, I developed avionics software and hardware that power hybrid rocket engines.

Academically, I work in the Computer Science Department as the Head Teaching Assistant for COMP 182. I have also served as the Head Teaching Assistant for COMP 382 and a Teaching Assistant for COMP 140 in the past.
