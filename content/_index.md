I major in computer science with minors in data science and mathematics at Rice 
University in Houston, TX.

My research interests are applications of machine learning and data science 
tools in natural language processing, bioinformatics, and formal methods.

From software engineering perspective, I have experience in Python and Java for 
building scalable applications, data analysis, machine learning, and deploying 
web applications; Node.JS for building server and multi-platform desktop 
applications; Javascript, HTML 5, and CSS for building UX-friendly user 
interfaces and web-design; SQL for databases.

I am an officer and the Avionics team lead at Rice Eclipse (a :rocket: club), 
developing avionics software and hardware. Additionally, I am also the chair
of I/O committee of undergraduate computer science club. Academically, I work in
the Computer Science Department at Rice University as a Teaching Assistant.
