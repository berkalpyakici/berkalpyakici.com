I am a junior majoring in computer science with minors in data science and 
mathematics at Rice University in Houston, TX. My research interests are 
applications of machine learning and data science tools in natural language 
processing, bioinformatics, and formal methods.

From software engineering perspective, I have experience in Python, Java, and C 
for building scalable applications, data science, and deploying web 
applications; Node.JS for building server and multi-platform desktop 
applications; Javascript, HTML 5, and CSS for building UX-friendly user 
interfaces and web-design; SQL for databases.

I am an officer and the Avionics team lead at Rice Eclipse (:rocket: club), 
developing avionics software and hardware. Additionally, I am also the chair
of I/O committee of Rice undergraduate computer science club. Academically, I 
work in the Computer Science Department at Rice University as the Head Teaching 
Assistant for COMP 182. In the past, I was the Head Teaching Assistant for COMP 
382 and a Teaching Assistant for COMP 140.
