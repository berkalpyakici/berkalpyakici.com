I am a senior majoring in computer science with minors in data science and 
mathematics at Rice University in Houston, TX. My research interests are 
applications of machine learning and data science tools in natural language 
processing, bioinformatics, and formal methods.

From software engineering perspective, I have experience in Python, Java, C, and 
R for building scalable applications, data science, and deploying web 
applications; Node.JS for building server and multi-platform desktop 
applications; Javascript, HTML 5, and CSS for building UX-friendly user 
interfaces and web-design; SQL for databases.

I am currently the Public Affairs Officer at Rice Eclipse (:rocket: club), 
previously serving as the Avionics team lead, developing avionics software and 
hardware that power our hybrid rocket engines. Additionally, I am the 
co-president of Rice undergraduate computer science club. Academically, I 
work in the Computer Science Department as the Head Teaching Assistant for 
COMP 382. In the past, I was the Head Teaching Assistant for COMP 182 and a 
Teaching Assistant for COMP 140.

After graduation, I will be joining Luay Nakhleh's Bioinformatics group as a
fifth-year masters with thesis student, developing solutions to phylogenetics
problems through data science. Feel free to reach out to me via "Contact"
