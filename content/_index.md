I am currently pursuing a master of science degree in the field of computer science as a fifth-year student at Rice University, advised by [Luay Nakhleh](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/). I graduated with a bachelor of science in computer science with a minor in data science from Rice University in May 2022.  

My research interests are the applications of machine learning methods in bioinformatics and natural language processing. My previously published research papers include dissimilarity measures for phylogenetic networks that take branch lengths into account.  

I have industry experience in Python, Java, and C for building distributed and scalable applications. Additionally, I used R, NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch in numerous data science projects that involve data visualization, analysis, machine learning, and more. Last but not the least, I used SQL for databases, as well as various NoSQL solutions (i.e. MongoDB).  

Some highlights of my undergraduate activities at Rice:
* Served as the Head Teaching Assistant for COMP 182 in Spring 2021 & Spring 2022 and for COMP 382 in Fall 2020 & Fall 2021; Teaching Assistant for COMP 140 in Spring 2019 & Fall 2020.
* Served as the Co-President of [Rice Computer Science Club](https://csclub.rice.edu/).
* Served as the Avionics Lead and Public Affairs Officer at [Rice Eclipse](http://eclipse.rice.edu/) (:rocket: club).
