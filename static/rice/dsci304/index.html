						Counter-Strike is a first-person competitive video game and one of the largest in terms of the number of active players.
                        Many professional teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments around the globe. In this project, we investigate patterns from
                        thousands of professional game records.

                <p>
                    First, we investigate which countries have more players competing in the professional scene. For this, we take a look at all professional
                    games played from November 2015 to March 2020, and create a frequency map of how many unique professional players have played at least one 
                    game per each country. Then, we represent this frequency on a world map, coloring each country with regards to the number of players being
                    represened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plot suggests that a very large number of playersare from the United States (1488), and there is a considerable number from European 
                    Union, Russia, China, Oceania, and Brazil.

                <p>
                    Each game is played on one of the seven official maps, and the teams usually veto maps before games begin. That way, out of seven maps 
                    in the circulation, only one of them gets played at each game. Sometimes, the games are played in the best-of-three (BO3) format, in which
                    each team veto one map, then pick one map, then veto one more map - and the remaining map becomes the third map in the game series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Across years, some maps get into the circulation and some maps leave. However, at any given time, there are always 7 maps in the competitive
                    pool. Thus, in this section, we investigate which maps were vetoed out in the recent three years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, we pick the maps that were in the competitive pool: In 2018 and 2019, there were two switches, and thus, we compare 8 maps.

                                We can observe that the most hated maps in 2018 were Nuke, Cache, and Overpass. On the other hand, Cobblestone, Mirage, and Dust 2
                                were more favorable.

                                Again, we can observe that the most hated maps in 2019 were Nuke and Overpass. Additionally, Train is higher up on the list this year.
                                On the other hand, Cache, Inferno, and Mirage were more favorable.

				<h3 class="uk-text-bold">Sided Maps</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons why maps get circulated in and out of the pool is because they are oftentimes sided. For context, each game consists of 30 rounds at
                    maximum (without overtime), where each team plays on CT and T sides for 15 rounds each. Some maps, due to their layout, give advantage to one of the sides.
                    As a result, the games become more predictable and oftentimes less entertaining. While this benefits some teams, some others are not really fond of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, we analyze the percentage of rounds won by the CT side for each map, in each month since November 2015 until March 2020. We observe that on average,
                    some maps lean towards CT and some maps lean towards T, and those who are heavily skewed are taken out of the competitive map pool and are added back when
                    the necessary changes are done on the maps.

				<h3 class="uk-text-bold">Top Teams</h3>
                <p>
                    There are various tiers in the professional scene (just like any other professional sports),
                    and global team rankings oftentime take this into account. One of the most popular (and widely accepted) rankings 
                    are produced by HLTV.org. Here, I rank teams based on a much simpler metric: The percentage of the games they won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some teams only played one or two games, making their winning rate oftentimes 100%. Thus here, I only rank teams that
                    have played at least 100 games during that year. This way, some lesser well know teams that outperform their opponents 
                    within their region and/or league are highlighted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some teams, like Sprout and AVANGAR placed top 10 in both 2018 and 2019.

				<h3 class="uk-text-bold">Equipment Value vs Win Rate</h3>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of each round, teams purchase equipment that help them eliminate their opponents and give them advantage in certain 
                    situations. To make the game more challenging, the developers added an in-game economy, where each player has a budget (0 - 16,000 dollars).
                    At the beginning each round, each player is rewarded based on their team's and their own performance in the previous round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, we investigate the relationship in between team's total equipment value and the likelihood of them winning the round. To achieve this, we 
                    make use of logistic regression.
                </p>
				<div class="uk-overflow-auto">
					<object data="p1.html" width="100%" height="700px"></object>
				</div>
                <p>
                    We can clearly observe that as the total equipment value increases, the team's likelihood of winning the round increases significantly as well.
                    However, it never goes down below about 20% and go above about 90%, which means that in certain sitautions, teams can still lose rounds if they
                    don't play strategically with their equipment. This makes room for very exciting (and sometimes upsetting) situations!
