## Project Structure
This project consists of a backend (built with Django v2.2) and a frontend (built with React v16.8).

`app/`: This directory stores the main Django files like settings, urls, and wsgi.  
`core/`: This is a Django project application that manages the models (settings) for the landing page (aka core website settings).  
`staticfiles/`: This directory is empty and is meant to store static files generated by Django.  
`webview/`: This directory stores all files for React frontend framework.

## Installation (on Dev Platform)
Clone this repository to your desktop:

Enter the directory and create a virtual environment for Python packages:

```

Activate the virtual environment:

Migrate the database (I use PostgreSQL, but Django supports [many](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/databases/) database engines):
```bash
python app/manage.py migrate
```

Create a super user (admin account), and follow the instructions:
```bash
python app/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Install NPM packages and build React webview:
```bash
cd webview/
yarn install
yarn run build
cd ..
```

Run Django server:

```

The server is now live on `localhost:8000`.
